### Hey there, I am Aman! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="27px">

My pronouns are (he/him). I am an engineering undergraduate from the [University of Delhi](https://ducic.ac.in/).

I am deeply passionate about **Technology**, **Space** and **Physics**. 

I am also an **open-source enthusiast** who is always keen to learn more about everything from **Privacy**, **AI**, **Cybersecurity** to **Climate Change**, **Social Issues** and **Sustainability**.

I'll be working with **[IRIS-HEP](https://iris-hep.org/fellows/amangoel185.html)** on the **[Hist](https://github.com/scikit-hep/hist)** project over the course of summer 2021.

I am actively exploring my options for pursuing higher studies, preferably in one of my interest areas, and if possible, at their intersection. 

Apart from this, I love photographs, words, exploring new things, travelling, and making friends. :)
