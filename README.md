## Hey there, I am Aman! üëãüèΩ

<!--<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="27px">-->

My pronouns are (he/him). I am a senior engineering undergraduate at the [University of Delhi](https://ducic.ac.in/).

I am deeply passionate about **Computer Science Research**, **Analysis Systems**, **Physics and Space**. I am majoring in _Information Technology_ and _Mathematical Innovations_.

I am also an open-source enthusiast who is always keen to learn more about everything from **Research Software**, **Ethics of Technology** to **Climate Change** and **Sustainability**.

Currently, I am working as an **[IRIS-HEP Fellow](https://iris-hep.org/fellows/amangoel185.html)** on the **[Hist](https://github.com/scikit-hep/hist)** and **[uproot-browser](https://github.com/henryiii/uproot-browser)** libraries.

I am actively exploring my options for pursuing a job in the field of [**Research Software Engineering**](https://us-rse.org/about/what-is-an-rse/). I believe it would further help me to pursue my higher studies, preferably in one of my interest areas, and if possible, at their intersection.

Apart from this, I love photographs, words, exploring new things, travelling, and making friends. Oh and ofcourse, cheese. :)
